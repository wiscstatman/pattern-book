On April 17/22, we ran eggbeater with colors through 70 beats [I balked at 70, needed 72 to get full cycle]!
We also did a first run of 345 eggbeater with colors, and Nathan worked out some interesting loop structure

Jan 2023, just after  Madfest.
We did the Hex of clovers for the big pattern...pretty fun with Chad on drums and getting our rhythms right.
It was a challenging pattern to set up, especially with me mixing up 6 and 8 counts!

at the fest, we also did a post feeding a 2pi/3, and with the addition of triples over the top between the post and
someone on the back side (Tom from Minneapolis).

we also did a fully-loaded broken hearted blast...pretty cool...several options for where to put the middle extra
person; we tried way outside the pattern, but I think we could also do it with him facing the same direction, offset
by 6 ft or so, as the two primary feeders.   It looks to me almost like a site-swap pattern, and might be the
basis of another big pattern

## August 20, 2023

We recently worked out what we're calling the 1-3-5 Turbo.  Same moves as standard Turbo, but there's a base 5 count and passes only happen on beats 1 and 3.  The feeder passes on both 1's and 3's, the movers skip one of those, and stay on 5 count.  The 4-in-a-row 2-count phenomena in the feeder position of the regular Turbo turns into 4 passes witha 3-count gap and 2 2-count gaps.  We note that potential variations, like 1-4-5 are equivalent, giving the said
gaps, but, a 1-2-5 would be like a chocolate start with three selves.  

Thought on naming 2 count is really 2/1 count = 2 beats/1 pass; and 3/2 count we know.
As you lengthen the cycle, there become multiple ways to put in the passes.  E.g. 4/2 count is a 4 beat cycle with
2 passes, which by simplification is just 2/1 or 2 count.  But it could be pass-pass-self-self instead of
pass-self-pass-self.  So the former could be written 4/1-2 count, where the regular 2-count is 4/1-3 count
In that new Turbo, we do a 5/1-3 count in the feed, followed by 4 copies of regular 5/1 count

## Nov 9 2023 (Thurs)

Me, Nick and Mel di some nice variations of 1-3-5 clover, where we alternate
the pass beat after each block of 5.  E.g., 1-3-5 then 1-2-5; or 1-3-5 x 2 then
1-2-5 x2...a good brain game

Idea to try: 7 count base, pass in 3 spots, like 1-3-6:7

We also do a nice extra club 1 feeds 2 pattern, which I don't think I've 
ever done, but it's pretty nice.  Just 7 3-count by the feeder, and the
feedees do 6 count either left or right.  If the feeder passes straights then the feedees cross, and vice versa.  Adding a switch side, the mover does a 7 count, which is nice compared to the move in the more common 2-count extra-club feed (where we need triples to balance it out).


## Dec 17, 2023

We try at MCS and sort of get my new pattern from yesterday..."Tricky Middle", which is a six-person variation of the 2pi/3.   4-loops, each with 3 marks (equidistant at 2pi/3 radians apart on each circle).  Circles are tied together like 4 balloons. People set up in alternate spots.  The steady state is pass to the left, pass to the right (next position); move across and pass back.   Pretty nice!
Any count you like, but 6 count or 5 count a good start. (See media/TrickyMiddle.jpg) There's a nice feature that after each passing beat some pair of jugglers moves through the middle, along parallel lines and in opposite directions (and they pass to each other after the move).   Further, on subsequent beats, the moves criss-cross, like a + sign, first left-right, next up-down, continuing.


## Feb 22, 2024

Last night we made progress on Mark's Killscreen...4 of us in box formation, one pair doing count A, the second doing count B,
with an offset start.   A nice one is 6ct/7cnt, offset by one at the start, which goes to 42 beats before full collision at 43!
(Mark [his idea], me, Mel, Nick)

## pre IJA

we figure an undending pattern...doing 3-leaf clover, 1-3 on 5/1-3-5 on 7/1-3-5-7 on 9, etc

## IJA 2024

Green Bay...we get tricky - in - the middle going, but the easier version than from 12/23...; 
Think of each of 4 loops as having 3 spots...say A/B/C, in order of movement by each juggler; then subsequent
 loops will have 2 then 1 then 2 then 1 jugglers at any point in the pattern.  Original Tricky-in-Middle had b<-->c passing
and A<-->A passing.   But it goes better, I think to have A<-->B and C<-->C...then you move quickly forward rather than
backward on each transition; run Saturday night at IJA (me/Mel/Keenan/Nathan/Steve/?/?Peter?)

## July 22, 2024

I started the version 4.0 last week by copying/modifying material withing a google doc


Idea...have a scoring/rating system for patterns...popularity and difficulty


## December 12, 2024

Last week and again today we had good runs of what we're calling the "Celtic Sheild Knot", which sets up like the old
`tricky in the middle`, but has a much better pass sequence so it's quite easy to do.  Set up as four connected loops; each
loop on the corner of a square.  I put clubs down at each loop, pointing into the center of the square.  Now each
club marks three positions: one on its left, one behind (outside), and one on its right (we don't couunt one inside).  With
four loops and 3 spots per loop we have 12 spots, and we put the six jugglers alternatively into 1/2 of these spots, where the direction of motion goes right-side --> left-side of loop on left --> back side --> right side ..
Notice that two of the loops have a single juggler and two have two; they are more or less symmetric pairs.
And the passing sequence is this: if you're the solo juggler in a loop you exchange with the outside juggler on your right.
That covers 4; the only others left are the two jugglers on the right-side of their respective loop; they exchange.  After an exchange, everyone advances one position.  It goes very nicely on 6 count, but surely 5 or 4 would be quite doable with a few reps.  

...we did this knot in the Madfest show (me, Mel, Chan, Goose, Keenan, and Mark!)


## Post madfest; end Feb 1 2025

The Madjugglers performance went pretty well (though me, Nathan, and Mel had a few restarts to
get the laxative working!

We tried the all-moving 26-person lemniscate for the big-pattern on Jan 19.   
People were keen and surprisingly positive about the try, but it never worked; the layout was far too compressed.  Prior to set up I thought it would be a bit compressed, but it got way too crowded at the crossing.  I considered
stretching the dimensions, but I worried that would make the cross-over step too far (more than 6 ft)
I need to reconfigure it, where we go 4 to 5 feet between steps on the lemniscate arc, and then
rather than have twice that being the crossing distance, somehow carve out the central cross separately and keep that at about 6 feet.   We also had undue compression with the 4 stationary jugglers
(who we set up as Kings in the card layout)


Last Thursday (Jan 30) we (me, Jeff, Mel, Nathan, and Carly) came up with a switch-sides version
of the egg-beater.  Easiest to try on 3-count base; remember the 8 standard egg-beater beats where
each mover does 2 passes at the top (on every other base beat) then moves to the bottom--in the 
standard they move to the bottom of their same side, but we worked out how they can cross to the
other side...letting the other sides bottom person pass on the next even beat, then cutting over
in front swapping roles with that juggler...that one takes your would-be next even beat and you
swing back to the top to take their next odd beat.   We worked out one way that all 4 movers can do that swapping; so far our version is asymmetric, with the juggler picking up the 2 bottom passes in a
row coming off the same side....various names; best is "stick a fork in it", since it took a while
to figure it out and get it "done"

5 person extra club star...on Feb 20/25, we figured out how to make a very cool extension, where
non-doublers are either selfing or in a straights star single...in the steady state each juggler does 
double - single/star - single/star - self - self, where the double is on their respective count (crossing and
always to the same person), and the singles are added to fill up the star, with rights to the right and
lefts to the lefts...tough pattern...I thought of adding singles, Peter and Nathan figured out exactly how
to get the max number and rhythm of the double sand singles
