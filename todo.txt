On April 17/22, we ran eggbeater with colors through 70 beats [I balked at 70, needed 72 to get full cycle]!
We also did a first run of 345 eggbeater with colors, and Nathan worked out some interesting loop structure

Jan 2023, just after  Madfest.
We did the Hex of clovers for the big pattern...pretty fun with Chad on drums and getting our rhythms right.
It was a challenging pattern to set up, especially with me mixing up 6 and 8 counts!

at the fest, we also did a post feeding a 2pi/3, and with the addition of triples over the top between the post and
someone on the back side (Tom from Minneapolis).

we also did a fully-loaded broken hearted blast...pretty cool...several options for where to put the middle extra
person; we tried way outside the pattern, but I think we could also do it with him facing the same direction, offset
by 6 ft or so, as the two primary feeders.   It looks to me almost like a site-swap pattern, and might be the
basis of another big pattern

## August 20, 2023

We recently worked out what we're calling the 1-3-5 Turbo.  Same moves as standard Turbo, but there's a base 5 count and passes only happen on beats 1 and 3.  The feeder passes on both 1's and 3's, the movers skip one of those, and stay on 5 count.  The 4-in-a-row 2-count phenomena in the feeder position of the regular Turbo turns into 4 passes witha 3-count gap and 2 2-count gaps.  We note that potential variations, like 1-4-5 are equivalent, giving the said
gaps, but, a 1-2-5 would be like a chocolate start with three selves.  

Thought on naming 2 count is really 2/1 count = 2 beats/1 pass; and 3/2 count we know.
As you lengthen the cycle, there become multiple ways to put in the passes.  E.g. 4/2 count is a 4 beat cycle with
2 passes, which by simplification is just 2/1 or 2 count.  But it could be pass-pass-self-self instead of
pass-self-pass-self.  So the former could be written 4/1-2 count, where the regular 2-count is 4/1-3 count
In that new Turbo, we do a 5/1-3 count in the feed, followed by 4 copies of regular 5/1 count

## Nov 9 2023 (Thurs)

Me, Nick and Mel di some nice variations of 1-3-5 clover, where we alternate
the pass beat after each block of 5.  E.g., 1-3-5 then 1-2-5; or 1-3-5 x 2 then
1-2-5 x2...a good brain game

Idea to try: 7 count base, pass in 3 spots, like 1-3-6:7

We also do a nice extra club 1 feeds 2 pattern, which I don't think I've 
ever done, but it's pretty nice.  Just 7 3-count by the feeder, and the
feedees do 6 count either left or right.  If the feeder passes straights then the feedees cross, and vice versa.  Adding a switch side, the mover does a 7 count, which is nice compared to the move in the more common 2-count extra-club feed (where we need triples to balance it out).
